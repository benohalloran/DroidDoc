{"methods":["[Expand] Inherited Methods","From class java.lang.Object Object clone() Creates and returns a copy of this Object. boolean equals(Object o) Compares this instance with the specified object and indicates if they are equal. void finalize() Invoked when the garbage collector has detected that this instance is no longer reachable. final Class<?> getClass() Returns the unique instance of Class that represents this object's class. int hashCode() Returns an integer hash code for this object. final void notify() Causes a thread which is waiting on this object's monitor (by means of calling one of the wait() methods) to be woken up. final void notifyAll() Causes all threads which are waiting on this object's monitor (by means of calling one of the wait() methods) to be woken up. String toString() Returns a string containing a concise, human-readable description of this object. final void wait() Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object. final void wait(long millis, int nanos) Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object or until the specified timeout expires. final void wait(long millis) Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object or until the specified timeout expires.","Object clone() Creates and returns a copy of this Object.","boolean equals(Object o) Compares this instance with the specified object and indicates if they are equal.","void finalize() Invoked when the garbage collector has detected that this instance is no longer reachable.","final Class<?> getClass() Returns the unique instance of Class that represents this object's class.","int hashCode() Returns an integer hash code for this object.","final void notify() Causes a thread which is waiting on this object's monitor (by means of calling one of the wait() methods) to be woken up.","final void notifyAll() Causes all threads which are waiting on this object's monitor (by means of calling one of the wait() methods) to be woken up.","String toString() Returns a string containing a concise, human-readable description of this object.","final void wait() Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object.","final void wait(long millis, int nanos) Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object or until the specified timeout expires.","final void wait(long millis) Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object or until the specified timeout expires."],"package":"android.os","constants":[],"class":"Build.VERSION","constructors":[],"fields":["public static final String CODENAME The current development codename, or the string \"REL\" if this is a release build.","public static final String INCREMENTAL The internal value used by the underlying source control to represent this build.","public static final String RELEASE The user-visible version string.","public static final String SDK This field was deprecated in API level 4.
