String toString() Returns a string containing a concise, human-readable description of this object. final void wait() Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object. final void wait(long millis, int nanos) Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object or until the specified timeout expires. final void wait(long millis) Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object or until the specified timeout expires.","Object clone() Creates and returns a copy of this Object.","boolean equals(Object o) Compares this instance with the specified object and indicates if they are equal.","void finalize() Invoked when the garbage collector has detected that this instance is no longer reachable.","final Class<?> getClass() Returns the unique instance of Class that represents this object's class.","int hashCode() Returns an integer hash code for this object.","final void notify() Causes a thread which is waiting on this object's monitor (by means of calling one of the wait() methods) to be woken up.","final void notifyAll() Causes all threads which are waiting on this object's monitor (by means of calling one of the wait() methods) to be woken up.","String toString() Returns a string containing a concise, human-readable description of this object.","final void wait() Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object.","final void wait(long millis, int nanos) Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object or until the specified timeout expires.","final void wait(long millis) Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object or until the specified timeout expires."],"package":"android.graphics","constants":["int A_8","int JPEG This constant was deprecated in API level 8. use ImageFormat.JPEG instead.","int LA_88","int L_8","int OPAQUE System chooses an opaque format (no alpha bits required)","int RGBA_4444","int RGBA_5551","int RGBA_8888","int RGBX_8888","int RGB_332","int RGB_565","int RGB_888","int TRANSLUCENT System chooses a format that supports translucency (many alpha bits)","int TRANSPARENT System chooses a format that supports transparency (at least 1 alpha bit)","int UNKNOWN","int YCbCr_420_SP This constant was deprecated in API level 8. use ImageFormat.NV21 instead.","int YCbCr_422_I This constant was deprecated in API level 8. use ImageFormat.YUY2 instead.","int YCbCr_422_SP This constant was deprecated in API level 8. use ImageFormat.NV16 instead."],"class":"PixelFormat","constructors":[],"fields":["public int bitsPerPixel","public int bytesPerPixel"]}
