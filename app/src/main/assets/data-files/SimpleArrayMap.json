{"methods":["void clear() Make the array map empty.","boolean containsKey(Object key) Check whether a key exists in the array.","boolean containsValue(Object value) Check whether a value exists in the array.","void ensureCapacity(int minimumCapacity) Ensure the array map can hold at least minimumCapacity items.","boolean equals(Object object) Compares this instance with the specified object and indicates if they are equal. This implementation returns false if the object is not a map, or if the maps have different sizes.","V get(Object key) Retrieve a value from the array.","int hashCode() Returns an integer hash code for this object.","int indexOfKey(Object key) Returns the index of a key in the set.","boolean isEmpty() Return true if the array map contains no items.","K keyAt(int index) Return the key at the given index in the array.","V put(K key, V value) Add a new value to the array map.","void putAll(SimpleArrayMap<? extends K, ? extends V> array) Perform a put(Object, Object) of all key/value pairs in array","V remove(Object key) Remove an existing key from the array map.","V removeAt(int index) Remove the key/value mapping at the given index.","V setValueAt(int index, V value) Set the value at a given index in the array.","int size() Return the number of items in this array map.","String toString() Returns a string containing a concise, human-readable description of this object.
