{"methods":["void append(int key, E value) Puts a key/value pair into the array, optimizing for the case where the key is greater than all existing keys in the array.","void clear() Removes all key-value mappings from this SparseArray.","SparseArray<E> clone() Creates and returns a copy of this Object.","void delete(int key) Removes the mapping from the specified key, if there was any.","E get(int key) Gets the Object mapped from the specified key, or null if no such mapping has been made.","E get(int key, E valueIfKeyNotFound) Gets the Object mapped from the specified key, or the specified Object if no such mapping has been made.","int indexOfKey(int key) Returns the index for which keyAt(int) would return the specified key, or a negative number if the specified key is not mapped.","int indexOfValue(E value) Returns an index for which valueAt(int) would return the specified key, or a negative number if no keys map to the specified value.","int keyAt(int index) Given an index in the range 0...size()-1, returns the key from the indexth key-value mapping that this SparseArray stores.","void put(int key, E value) Adds a mapping from the specified key to the specified value, replacing the previous mapping from the specified key if there was one.","void remove(int key) Alias for delete(int).","void removeAt(int index) Removes the mapping at the specified index.","void removeAtRange(int index, int size) Remove a range of mappings as a batch.","void setValueAt(int index, E value) Given an index in the range 0...size()-1, sets a new value for the indexth key-value mapping that this SparseArray stores.","int size() Returns the number of key-value mappings that this SparseArray currently stores.","String toString() Returns a string containing a concise, human-readable description of this object.
