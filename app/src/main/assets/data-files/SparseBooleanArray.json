{"methods":["void append(int key, boolean value) Puts a key/value pair into the array, optimizing for the case where the key is greater than all existing keys in the array.","void clear() Removes all key-value mappings from this SparseBooleanArray.","SparseBooleanArray clone() Creates and returns a copy of this Object.","void delete(int key) Removes the mapping from the specified key, if there was any.","boolean get(int key) Gets the boolean mapped from the specified key, or false if no such mapping has been made.","boolean get(int key, boolean valueIfKeyNotFound) Gets the boolean mapped from the specified key, or the specified value if no such mapping has been made.","int indexOfKey(int key) Returns the index for which keyAt(int) would return the specified key, or a negative number if the specified key is not mapped.","int indexOfValue(boolean value) Returns an index for which valueAt(int) would return the specified key, or a negative number if no keys map to the specified value.","int keyAt(int index) Given an index in the range 0...size()-1, returns the key from the indexth key-value mapping that this SparseBooleanArray stores.","void put(int key, boolean value) Adds a mapping from the specified key to the specified value, replacing the previous mapping from the specified key if there was one.","int size() Returns the number of key-value mappings that this SparseBooleanArray currently stores.","String toString() Returns a string containing a concise, human-readable description of this object.
