{"methods":["[Expand] Inherited Methods","From class java.lang.Object Object clone() Creates and returns a copy of this Object. boolean equals(Object o) Compares this instance with the specified object and indicates if they are equal. void finalize() Invoked when the garbage collector has detected that this instance is no longer reachable. final Class<?> getClass() Returns the unique instance of Class that represents this object's class. int hashCode() Returns an integer hash code for this object. final void notify() Causes a thread which is waiting on this object's monitor (by means of calling one of the wait() methods) to be woken up. final void notifyAll() Causes all threads which are waiting on this object's monitor (by means of calling one of the wait() methods) to be woken up. String toString() Returns a string containing a concise, human-readable description of this object. final void wait() Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object. final void wait(long millis, int nanos) Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object or until the specified timeout expires. final void wait(long millis) Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object or until the specified timeout expires.","Object clone() Creates and returns a copy of this Object.","boolean equals(Object o) Compares this instance with the specified object and indicates if they are equal.","void finalize() Invoked when the garbage collector has detected that this instance is no longer reachable.","final Class<?> getClass() Returns the unique instance of Class that represents this object's class.","int hashCode() Returns an integer hash code for this object.","final void notify() Causes a thread which is waiting on this object's monitor (by means of calling one of the wait() methods) to be woken up.","final void notifyAll() Causes all threads which are waiting on this object's monitor (by means of calling one of the wait() methods) to be woken up.","String toString() Returns a string containing a concise, human-readable description of this object.","final void wait() Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object.","final void wait(long millis, int nanos) Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object or until the specified timeout expires.","final void wait(long millis) Causes the calling thread to wait until another thread calls the notify() or notifyAll() method of this object or until the specified timeout expires."],"package":"android.net.wifi","constants":["int CCMP AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC [RFC 3610, IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]","int TKIP Temporal Key Integrity Protocol [IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]","int WEP104 WEP104 = WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) with 104-bit key","int WEP40 WEP40 = WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) with 40-bit key (original 802.11)","String varName"],"class":"WifiConfiguration.GroupCipher","constructors":[],"fields":["public static final String[] strings"]}
